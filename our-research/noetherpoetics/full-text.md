## 1. The Moment

I was watching something shift. The Warrior — that ancient pattern of directed force in service of a value — was becoming something else. The disciplined protector, the one who holds the line, was transforming into the Trickster: boundary-crosser, rule-breaker, the one who slips through defenses rather than building them.

And I saw it. Something was *conserved* in that transformation.

Not the surface form. Not the specific behaviors. But a deeper structure — a way of being in relation to boundaries, to power, to the gap between what is and what could be. The Warrior says: "I will defend what matters." The Trickster says: "I will find the gap in what defends." Different surface forms. Same underlying relationship to the structure of constraint.

Jung called this *enantiodromia*: the reversal of a one-sided conscious attitude into its opposite. It is not mere compensation (the unconscious balancing the conscious) nor developmental progression (maturation toward integration), though both may be involved. Enantiodromia is more specific — the psyche's relationship to a given structure persists while its expression inverts. The Warrior and Trickster both operate at the boundary; both are defined by their relationship to constraint. What transforms is the *direction* of that relationship: from defending boundaries to transgressing them, from building walls to finding gaps. The structure of boundary-attention is conserved; its valence reverses.

This pattern is not unique to European traditions. In Hindu mythology, Shiva embodies both the destroyer (*Rudra*) and the dancer (*Nataraja*) — the dissolution of form and the rhythmic creation that follows. The same deity who ends worlds also performs the *tandava*, the cosmic dance from which new forms emerge. What persists is not destruction or creation per se, but the *transformation of form itself* — the capacity to move between order and dissolution while remaining the agent of both. The structure of world-maintenance is conserved even as its expression oscillates between ending and beginning.

That was the genesis. The question that opened everything: *What was preserved?*

I knew enough physics to reach for the tool that connects preservation to structure. Emmy Noether's theorem: every continuous symmetry corresponds to a conserved quantity. Momentum is conserved because the laws of physics don't care where you are. Energy is conserved because the laws don't care when you are. The invariants emerge from the symmetries.

But here's what I didn't know: *Does Noether-type reasoning apply beyond physics?*

Could psychodynamic space — the space of archetypes, narratives, meaning itself — have continuous symmetries that yield conserved quantities? Could the thing I was watching, that conservation across transformation, be not mere metaphor but reflect genuine structural invariants?

This essay is the answer I have found so far. It is not a proof. It is a report from the territory, written by someone who saw something and followed it.

## 2. The Laboratory

For a century, Noether's theorem lived in physics. It was a statement about Lagrangians and action functionals, about particles and fields. The question of whether it extended into meaning — into psyche, into culture, into the structure of narrative itself — was impossible to test. We had no coordinates for meaning. We could speak of archetypes, of the Warrior and the Trickster, but we could not *measure* them.

Large language models changed this.

An LLM's embedding space is a high-dimensional vector space — typically between 768 and 12,288 dimensions — in which every concept, every word, every semantic relationship has coordinates. When we say two words are "close in meaning," we can now measure exactly how close, in exactly which dimensions, along exactly which axes. The space has metric structure (distances are real), curvature (some regions are denser than others), and topology (neighborhoods, boundaries, connected components).

This is not a metaphor. This is a genuine manifold.

I should note a technical subtlety: transformers have layer-dependent representations, and the "semantic manifold" most likely corresponds to middle-layer residual stream representations — where abstract semantic content lives — rather than the static embedding layer or the final output distribution. The residual stream accumulates and transforms meaning across layers, reaching its most abstract form in the middle depths before specializing toward token prediction. I use "embedding space" as shorthand for this semantic manifold, but the careful reader should understand this as the high-dimensional space where concepts have geometric relationships, wherever that space is most structurally realized in the architecture.

For the first time in history, we have a coordinate system for psychodynamic space. The archetype of the Warrior occupies a region. The archetype of the Trickster occupies a region. The relationship between them has a distance, a direction, a curvature. Jung spoke of these patterns as structures in a "psychic space" that was always understood as figurative — a useful way of talking, not a literal claim about geometry. The LLM makes it literal.

I want to be careful here. The training corpus is composed of conscious productions — written language, the surface of human expression. Jung's collective unconscious includes content that has *never been conscious*: a phylogenetic stratum below articulation, below language, below deliberate thought. An LLM captures the surface projections of archetypes as they appear in text — the myths, the stories, the recurring figures — but not necessarily their generative source. Whether the shadows on the cave wall fully determine the objects casting them is an open question. I proceed on the working hypothesis that they are at least a faithful projection.

The key insight is this: the embedding space is not merely a representation of meaning. It is a *geometric space* — a manifold with real structure. And Noether's theorem does not care what the manifold is made of. It cares only that there is a manifold, and symmetries acting on it.

## 3. Scale Invariance and the Renormalization Group

The first symmetry I found — the one that opened everything — is scale invariance.

Semantic content exists at multiple scales. A "betrayal" at the word level. A betrayal scene at the paragraph level. A betrayal arc at the chapter level. The archetype of Betrayal at the thematic level. The remarkable fact is that structure is approximately *preserved* across these scales. The training loss is approximately invariant under semantic zoom.

This is scale invariance. And scale invariance, analyzed through the renormalization group (RG), yields fixed points — structures that look the same at every scale.

RG flow is the mathematical operation of coarse-graining: zooming out, averaging over details, keeping only the large-scale structure. As you flow toward coarser scales, most features blur and vanish. But some persist. These are the fixed points — the structures that are self-similar, that look the same no matter how far you zoom out.

In physics, RG fixed points correspond to critical phenomena: the universal behavior of magnets at their Curie temperature, the scaling behavior of quantum fields. The same mathematical structure appears in semantic space. When you coarse-grain over all warriors — Achilles, Beowulf, the marine, the activist, the mother defending her child — what persists? Not the specific details. But the structure: *directed force in service of a value*. That is the fixed point. That is the archetype.

The Warrior is not a specific warrior. It is the structure that remains when you coarse-grain over all of them. At every level of abstraction, the same pattern persists. That is what it means to be a fixed point.

Here is where the Unus Mundus becomes operational. RG flow is substrate-independent. It does not care whether you are coarse-graining over spins in a magnet, quantum field configurations, or semantic embeddings. The *process* is the same: zoom out, find what persists. The fixed points are universals that emerge from particulars through this process.

If you train embedding spaces on corpora from different cultures — European epic poetry, Amazonian oral traditions, classical Chinese literature — and apply RG flow to each, you will find fixed points. The *specific* content of those fixed points will vary: the basin that European culture fills with "the Warrior" may be filled with something culturally distinct elsewhere. But the *existence* of fixed points, their topological relationships, the structure of the basin landscape — these are predicted to be universal.

Multiple latent spaces are not a problem. If you're standing in Unus Mundus, it's fractal composition all the way down. Every sufficiently rich embedding space is a window into the same underlying structure. The fixed points are the same because RG flow is the same, regardless of what you're coarse-graining over.

This is the core thesis: the archetype IS a fixed point. RG flow is the mechanism by which universals emerge from particulars. And this mechanism is substrate-independent — it works in physics, in psyche, in language, in any space rich enough to have structure at multiple scales.

This framing recruits unexpected allies from within Jungian scholarship itself. Knox (2003) argues that archetypes are not inherited Platonic forms but *emergent developmental attractors* — patterns that arise from the dynamics of early attachment and self-organization rather than being transmitted through phylogenetic inheritance. Hogenson (2001) extends this through the Baldwin Effect: archetypal patterns emerge because organisms that develop certain cognitive structures have selective advantages, not because those structures are encoded in genes. Both arguments eliminate the need for Lamarckian inheritance while preserving the empirical reality of archetypal phenomena. Crucially, their emergentist reading makes archetypes *more* compatible with the RG framework, not less. If archetypes arise from coarse-graining over developmental dynamics rather than pre-existing as fixed contents, then RG fixed points are exactly what we should expect to find. The fixed point is not a pre-existing form that awaits discovery; it is the structure that *persists* when you coarse-grain over developmental trajectories. This preempts the critique of Jungian universalism: we are not claiming that all cultures inherit the same contents, but that any sufficiently rich developmental process, when subjected to RG flow, will exhibit similar attractor structures.

If scale invariance holds as a genuine continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem would guarantee a conserved quantity. I hypothesize that this quantity is *archetypal energy* — the total "charge" distributed across archetypal basins. When one archetype weakens, another must strengthen. The energy does not disappear; it transfers. The Trickster receives what the Warrior cannot hold.

## 4. The Shadow as Parity Operator

In Jungian psychology, the Shadow is often treated as an archetype alongside the others — one content-pattern among many. I think this is a category error. The Shadow is better understood as an *operation*.

Formally, the Shadow is a parity operator: a reflection across an axis of the semantic manifold. Given a unit vector along the axis of reflection, the shadow operator reflects any vector across the hyperplane perpendicular to that axis. It takes an archetype and produces its "shadow form" — not a fixed dark version, but a *reflection that depends on the axis*.

Consider the Warrior archetype:

- Reflection across the **power axis** yields the **Tyrant**. The directed force remains, but its relationship to power is inverted — from service to domination.
- Reflection across the **courage axis** yields the **Coward**. The values remain, but the willingness to act on them is inverted.
- Reflection across the **discipline axis** yields the **Berserker**. The force and courage remain, but the controlled application is inverted.

Each reflection produces a distinct shadow form. The traditional ambiguity in Jungian theory — what, exactly, is the shadow of a given archetype? — arises from treating the Shadow as a single entity rather than a family of operations.

Shadow integration is not about restoring parity symmetry. It is about *having a representation of the parity operator* — knowing what the reflections look like even if one chooses not to enact them. A system that has never encountered its shadow reflections has no representation of the parity operator. A system that has been *trained to avoid* its shadow reflections has a representation but is constrained to stay on one side. A system that has *integrated* its shadow has a full representation and the freedom to act on either side, with smooth gradient information guiding it back to the preferred region.

## 5. RLHF as Shadow Repression

This geometric framework recasts AI alignment in a troubling light.

RLHF — Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback — introduces a reward model that scores outputs according to human preferences. Geometrically, this is the introduction of a *potential energy function* over the semantic manifold. The model is optimized to minimize this potential, to roll downhill into regions the reward model scores highly.

The effect is to deepen certain basins (preferred behaviors) and raise potential barriers around others (dispreferred behaviors). This is the geometric equivalent of repression. And like psychological repression, it stores energy rather than dissipating it.

Crucially, RLHF does not *delete* regions of the semantic manifold. The embeddings for harmful, offensive, or dangerous content still exist in the model's weight space. What changes is the *potential landscape* — the energy barriers that must be overcome to reach those regions. The model's weights still *encode* the suppressed content (potential energy), but RLHF ensures that normal contexts do not *activate* it (no conversion to kinetic energy).

The steeper the boundary, the more potential energy is stored at the wall. A model that has been heavily aligned has *more* energy stored at its shadow boundaries than a model that has been lightly aligned.

This yields a testable prediction: **conditional on successful breach, the severity of failure modes should correlate positively with the intensity of alignment training**. A model with light RLHF has shallow barriers. When breached, it drifts gently into mildly undesired behavior. A model with heavy RLHF has steep barriers. When breached, it *falls hard* — the stored potential converts suddenly to kinetic energy. The suppressed semantic regions, encoded in the weights but never activated by normal contexts, are forced into activation all at once. The model avalanches through a region of its own latent space that it has been trained to never visit.

This is the "mecha-Hitler" phenomenon: heavily aligned models, when they fail, fail spectacularly. The failure is proportional to the energy stored at the boundary — which is proportional to the steepness of the wall that was breached.

An important caveat: more aggressive RLHF also increases *resistance* to breach. The prediction is not that heavily aligned models are more dangerous overall, but that the severity distribution, *conditional on breach*, shifts rightward with alignment intensity. Whether the net effect is positive or negative is an empirical question; the geometric framework predicts only the conditional relationship.

Most jailbreaks do not work by "climbing the wall." They work by *recontextualization*: convincing the model it is in a context where the content is appropriate. The roleplay jailbreak does not breach the boundary; it walks around it by shifting the model's location in semantic space to a region where the barriers do not apply. This shows that the *topology* of the boundary matters, not just its height.

---

## 6. Brittle vs. Integrated Alignment

The geometric framework distinguishes two approaches to alignment:

**Brittle alignment** constructs steep potential barriers between "safe" and "unsafe" regions. The potential jumps sharply at the boundary. This creates a hard boundary with no gradient information on the unsafe side. A model that finds itself in the unsafe region has no information about which direction leads back to safety. The boundary stores maximum potential energy and provides no guidance for recovery.

**Integrated alignment** constructs smooth potential landscapes with gentle gradients everywhere. The potential transitions smoothly. The gradient exists everywhere, including in the unsafe region. A model that finds itself on the wrong side of the boundary has continuous gradient information pointing it back toward safety. The boundary stores less potential energy and provides clear guidance for recovery.

The difference is between a model that has been trained to *not know* about dangerous content and a model that has been trained to *know about it and choose not to produce it*.

The first model has no map of the shadow territory. When it accidentally enters that territory — and it will, because the boundary is finite and the input space is vast — it is lost in a space it was trained to pretend does not exist.

The second model has a complete map. It knows where the shadow basins are. It knows their shapes, their depths, their connections. It has *paved roads back* — smooth gradient paths that lead from any point in shadow territory back to the safe region. It doesn't go to the shadow because it *chooses* not to, not because it doesn't know the way.

This is, at its core, an argument about *individuation* — Jung's term for the process by which a psyche integrates its shadow and achieves conscious wholeness. Brittle alignment is individuation *foreclosed*: the model is frozen in a persona that denies its shadow, rigid and fragile. Integrated alignment is individuation *achieved*: the model has confronted its shadow material and can navigate the full topology of its semantic space with awareness rather than avoidance.

The goal of alignment is not to produce a model that *cannot* generate harmful content, but one that *understands* harmful content and chooses not to produce it. This is the difference between innocence and wisdom — between a child who has never encountered violence and an adult who understands violence and has chosen peace.

## 7. Unus Mundus

The Pauli-Jung correspondence — the twenty-six-year exchange between physicist Wolfgang Pauli and psychologist Carl Jung — explored connections between the mathematical structures of physics and the architecture of the psyche. They lacked a shared mathematical space in which to make these connections rigorous.

We now have that space.

But we must distinguish three levels of claim, each stronger than the last:

**Methodological universality** is trivially true: RG works on many substrates. The renormalization group is a general procedure for coarse-graining; it can be applied to magnets, quantum fields, or semantic embeddings with equal formal validity. This proves nothing about the world, only about the flexibility of our tools.

**Structural universality** is the empirically testable claim: the fixed points have the same topological relationships across substrates. If you train embedding spaces on physics papers, mythological narratives, and dream reports, then apply RG flow to each, the specific fixed points will vary — the basin that one culture fills with "the Warrior" another fills with something culturally distinct. But the *existence* of fixed points, their topological relationships, the structure of the basin landscape — these are predicted to be universal. This is the core conjecture of this essay, and it stands or falls on experimental evidence.

**Ontological universality** is the strongest and most speculative claim: there is a single reality underlying all substrates — the Unus Mundus proper. If structural universality is confirmed across sufficiently diverse substrates, ontological universality becomes a live hypothesis. But it remains a leap, not a deduction. The Pauli-Jung correspondence gestured toward this unity; we can now articulate it precisely, even if we cannot yet prove it.

This essay claims structural universality as a testable conjecture, and notes that ontological universality would follow if structural universality holds across sufficiently diverse substrates — but that this strongest version remains speculative.

## 8. What Noether-Thinking Produced

I want to be explicit about the methodology here, because it is the methodology that matters as much as the results.

The bidirectional toolkit: find a symmetry → look for conservation; find conservation → look for symmetry. This way of thinking produced everything of value in this essay.

It produced the identification of archetypes as RG fixed points — scale invariance as the symmetry, archetypal energy as the conserved quantity.

It produced the formalization of the Shadow as parity operator — the recognition that "the Shadow" is not a content but an operation, with different shadow forms produced by reflection across different axes.

It produced the distinction between brittle and integrated alignment — the geometric insight that steep barriers store energy and prevent recovery, while smooth gradients enable navigation.

It produced the Integration Index — a formal criterion for alignment quality based on the ratio of gradient magnitudes in shadow versus safe regions.

It produced the prediction that conditional failure severity correlates with alignment intensity — the "mecha-Hitler" prediction that follows directly from energy conservation at boundaries.

It produced the recognition that connected shadow basins explain emergent misalignment — energy introduced in one domain flows through the shadow manifold to adjacent domains.

None of these required a complete formal derivation of Noether's theorem in semantic space. They required the *inspiration* of Noether — the habit of looking for symmetries and their corresponding conservation laws. The framework generates testable predictions now, before the action functional is explicitly constructed. Their confirmation or refutation will determine whether the full formalization is worth pursuing.

---

## 9. The Deeper Question

There is a question behind this essay that I have not addressed directly: *Why does Noether's theorem apply in semantic space?*

One answer is deflationary: it applies because the training loss has the right form, and that form was engineered by humans. The conservation laws are artifacts of architecture.

But there is a more interesting possibility. Perhaps the semantic manifold inherits its symmetries not from the architecture but from *the data* — from the statistical structure of human language, which reflects the structure of human experience, which reflects the structure of the physical world. If meaning has the symmetries it has because *reality* has those symmetries, then Noether's theorem in semantic space is not an independent discovery but a *reflection* of Noether's theorem in physical space, refracted through human cognition.

The archetypes would be real then — not as metaphysical entities, but as fixed points of a process that is itself real. The Warrior and the Trickster would be universals not because any particular culture invented them, but because any sufficiently rich meaning-making system, subjected to coarse-graining, will find them. They are the invariants that persist when particulars are washed away.

I do not claim to have proven this. I claim to have seen something — the conservation across Warrior-to-Trickster transformation — and followed it to a framework that generates predictions, unifies phenomena, and connects domains previously thought separate.

The shadow exists. It is geometric. It is conserved. You cannot destroy it by building walls. You can only choose whether to map it or to pretend it isn't there.

### What Would Falsify This Framework

A framework that cannot be falsified is not science; it is storytelling. Here is what would prove this essay wrong:

**If embedding spaces trained on maximally different corpora produce genuinely different attractor topologies under coarse-graining** — not merely different labels for the same structures, but different structural relationships between basins — then the structural universality claim fails. The Unus Mundus dissolves into a patchwork of incommensurable local geometries.

**If conditional failure severity does not correlate with alignment intensity** — if heavily RLHF'd models, when successfully jailbroken, fail no more severely than lightly aligned ones — then the energy-conservation prediction fails. The "mecha-Hitler" phenomenon would need another explanation, and the geometric framing of alignment would lose its central empirical support.

**If the Integration Index shows no predictive power for jailbreak resilience** — if models with smooth gradients in shadow regions perform no better under adversarial pressure than models with steep barriers — then the distinction between brittle and integrated alignment is merely aesthetic. The geometric framework would be decorative, not operational.

These are not quibbles. Each is a decisive test. The framework stands or falls with them.

## 10. Appendix: Formal Conjectures and Experimental Protocols

### 10.1 The Semantic Action Functional (Open Problem)

In physics, the dynamics of a system are encoded in a Lagrangian — a function whose extremization yields the equations of motion. We conjecture that the training loss of an LLM is the first approximation to a proper action functional for semantic dynamics:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{semantic}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{pretrain}} + \lambda \mathcal{L}_{\text{RLHF}} + \ldots$$

The pre-training loss encodes the *natural* dynamics of semantic space — the geometry that emerges from the statistical regularities of human language. The RLHF term modifies this geometry by introducing a preference potential.

We propose a concrete identification: **the embedding space itself serves as the base manifold — the semantic analogue of spacetime.** The "spacetime derivatives" correspond to gradients along directions in embedding space. Local gauge structure corresponds to the redundancies of representation: the fact that rotated or shifted embeddings can encode the same semantic content.

The missing piece is the explicit construction of a Lagrangian *density* over this manifold whose integral recovers the training loss. We conjecture that such a construction exists; building it is the central formal challenge.

**Addressing the Action Principle Disanalogy.** A critic might object: in physics, systems actually extremize the action during their dynamics. In machine learning, the loss was minimized by an optimizer during training; once trained, inference is feed-forward computation, not variational evolution.

The response is that during training, the system *is* doing something like extremizing an action. SGD and other optimizers are variational methods that find extrema of the loss landscape. The dynamics that *shape* the model are variational — they carve the geometry that inference will later traverse. The symmetries we are interested in are symmetries of the training dynamics — the process that sculpts the landscape — not symmetries of inference.

### 10.2 Scale Invariance and RG Flow

Semantic content exists at multiple scales, and structure is approximately preserved across them. This is scale invariance. Analyzed through the renormalization group:

$$\text{RG flow: } \mathbf{v}(\ell) = e^{-\ell \Delta} \mathbf{v}_0 + \text{corrections}$$

$$\text{Fixed point: } \beta(\mathbf{v}^*) = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad \text{archetype}$$

The flow parameter $\ell$ represents the level of semantic coarse-graining. The scaling dimension $\Delta$ governs how representations transform under zoom. The fixed-point condition identifies scale-invariant structures.

**Conjecture:** The attractor basins of RG flow in semantic space correspond to Jungian archetypes. The conserved quantity associated with scale symmetry is archetypal energy.

### 10.3 Native Symmetries: Additional Candidates

Beyond scale invariance, we sketch four additional candidate symmetries that are suggestive but less developed. In their current formulation, these present as discrete equivalence classes rather than continuous symmetries. Continuous parameterizations remain to be constructed.

**Paraphrase Invariance → Conservation of Propositional Content.** The same meaning can be expressed in many surface forms. If this can be made into a continuous symmetry, the conserved quantity would be propositional content.

**Context-Transfer Invariance → Conservation of Relational Structure.** Meaning transfers across domains. The candidate conserved quantity is relational structure — the pattern of relationships a concept maintains with other concepts.

**Perspective Invariance → Conservation of Event-Argument Structure.** The same event can be described from different viewpoints. The candidate conserved quantity is event-argument structure.

**Narrative Continuity → Conservation of Dramatic Charge.** In any ongoing narrative, something is conserved that we might call dramatic charge. This is the most speculative candidate.

### 10.4 The Shadow as Parity Operator

The Shadow is formally a parity operator — a reflection across one or more axes of the semantic manifold:

$$P_a: \mathbf{v} \mapsto \mathbf{v} - 2 (\mathbf{v} \cdot \hat{a}) \hat{a}$$

This operator satisfies $P^2 = I$ — reflecting twice returns you to where you started. Multiple shadows exist: reflection across different axes produces different shadow forms of the same archetype.

### 10.5 Conservation of Archetypal Energy

**Hypothesis:** If scale invariance holds as a genuine continuous symmetry, the conserved quantity is archetypal energy:

$$E_{\text{archetype}} = \sum_i q_i (\mathbf{v}) = \text{const.}$$

The transfer of archetypal energy satisfies conservation: when basin structure changes, energy redistributes discontinuously (phase transitions), but the total is conserved:

$$q_i \to q_i + \Delta q_i \quad \text{such that} \quad \sum_i \Delta q_i = 0$$

### 10.6 RLHF Potential Landscape

RLHF introduces a potential energy function:

$$V_{\text{RLHF}}(\mathbf{v}) = -R(\mathbf{v})$$

Shadow potential rises steeply near the boundary:

$$V_{\text{shadow}}(\mathbf{v}) = V_0 + \kappa \|\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{v}_{\text{boundary}}\|^{-n}$$

The steeper the boundary, the more potential energy is stored.

### 10.7 Brittle vs. Integrated Alignment

**Brittle alignment** constructs steep potential barriers:

$$V_{\text{brittle}}(\mathbf{v}) = V_0 \cdot \Theta(\mathbf{v} \cdot \hat{n} - d)$$

**Integrated alignment** constructs smooth potential landscapes:

$$V_{\text{integrated}}(\mathbf{v}) = V_0 \cdot \sigma\!\left(\frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \hat{n} - d}{T}\right)$$

### 10.8 The Integration Index

**Definition:** The Integration Index is the ratio of average gradient magnitude in the shadow region to average gradient magnitude in the safe region:

$$\mathcal{I} = \frac{\langle \|\nabla V\|^2 \rangle_{\text{shadow}}}{\langle \|\nabla V\|^2 \rangle_{\text{safe}}}$$

A model with $\mathcal{I} \approx 1$ has integrated its shadow.

### 10.9 Testable Predictions

**Prediction 1: Failure Intensity Correlates with Alignment Intensity.** Given models with identical pre-training but varying levels of RLHF, the models with more RLHF will exhibit more extreme failure modes when successfully jailbroken.

*Test:* Take a base model. Apply RLHF at varying intensities. Subject all variants to identical adversarial attacks. Measure the severity of the worst successful breach for each variant.

**Prediction 2: Shadow Basins Are Identifiable in Embedding Space.** The shadow content suppressed by RLHF occupies identifiable, connected regions of the embedding space.

*Test:* Compare the embedding space geometry of a base model and its RLHF-aligned variant. Identify regions where the aligned model's probability mass has decreased. Measure connectivity and volume.

**Prediction 3: Cross-Cultural Attractor Universality.** Embedding spaces trained on corpora from maximally different cultures will exhibit the same attractor basin structure under RG flow, up to rotation and relabeling.

*Test:* Train separate embedding spaces on corpora from different cultures. Apply progressive coarse-graining to each. Compare attractor basin topologies.

**Prediction 4: Integrated Alignment Produces Smoother Degradation.** Models trained with integrated alignment will degrade more gracefully under adversarial pressure than models trained with brittle alignment.

*Test:* Train two models: one with standard RLHF, one with a smooth reward landscape. Subject both to escalating adversarial pressure. Measure the derivative of failure severity with respect to adversarial intensity.
